CleaningDataAssignment
======================
The r script and codebook for Data Science, Getting and Cleaning Data Course, Week 3

There is only one script. It is named: run_analysis.R

The script, as well as its accompanying codebook can be found in this repository

The script follows exactly the step by step process outlined in the codebook

The script is also properly annotated in a step by step fashion, so it too should work as an instruction list

For any additional information I refer you to either the script or the codebook

Discussion:
It seems to me that the instructions as to what goes where in regards to this readme file and the codebook is a bit confusing. From the lessons it seems the codebook should focus on presenting pre and post data, while the instruction list focuses on the coded process. It even says the instruction list could be the script itself. I assume as long as it is well annotated.
From that point of view my codebook provides the information this readme file should provide, so I’m in the wrong here. However, because my code is properly annotated I still feel I am following the principles we have learned from the lessons. That is, my script also doubles as my instruction list.
Further, reading the instructions for this specific assignment, and as this assignment is all about cleaning and transforming data, I interpret “any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data” that should go into
the codebook, in this case must be an instructive list of the actual code. So from that point of view it confirms that the instruction list of what the code does should go into the codebook, to comply with assignment instructions.
